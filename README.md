# Malicious URL Detection System using Machine Learning

## Introduction

The Internet has become an essential part of daily life, but with its convenience comes risksâ€”specifically the spread of malicious URLs designed to perform phishing, malware delivery, identity theft, and fraud. Traditional URL detection methods like blacklists and manual checks are ineffective against evolving threats. This project uses Machine Learning to develop a system that automatically detects malicious URLs by analyzing their lexical and structural properties.

##  Problem Statement

The goal is to build an accurate and efficient ML model that:

1. Extracts meaningful features from URLs.
2. Classifies URLs into **Benign** or **Malicious**.
3. Provides real-time prediction capability.
4. Minimizes false positives and maximizes detection accuracy.
